# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

### Goal ðŸ¥…

This project was extracted from Front-End mentor, and executed by me to perform page styling and html writing training.

In 12 days of work, I already see a lot of progress in my knowledge in html and css, and the applications are already evolving a lot. Knowledge of properties and tags, and their use.

In this project, I used flexbox, and I started the project with the mobile first technique.
